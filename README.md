# NasaTechCards
Testing the public NASA api to display tech as cards. Aiming to get a set of reusable components in the process.

Major TODOs:

- Complete responsive stylesheets. 1920x1080s was the only viewport used during development, only very minor considerations was given to lower resolutions.
- Full browser integration. Firefox has non-stylable scrollbars, and some buttons are missing styles as well.

To have the app running, just

`yarn install`

and

`yarn start`

should be enough.
