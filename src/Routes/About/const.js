Through the use of a web-based portal we gather technology investment information from across the Agency and transform the information into opportunities for collaboration and partnerships, analyses of how we are meeting mission needs, and data visualization of key technology drivers that enable Agency decision making."
export const title3 = "Why we do it";

That's why we designed a system that showcases the exciting, novel and crosscutting activities taking place at NASA. Whether it's a concept in its early stage, a prototype, or a fully developed technology - it's all here in TechPort. We invite you to come look around!"
