However, through the open loop flight test campaign, the Navigation Doppler Lidar component of COBALT achieved TRL5. The project was unable to perform the planned closed loop flight campaign due to technical difficulties with the system avionics. The project has reformulated into a FY18 new start called SPLICE.       The COBALT Project integrated a navigation payload onboard the Masten Space Systems xodiac suborbital rocket vehicle and performed three tethered tests and two free flights. The COBALT navigation solution blends a NASA Doppler LIDAR velocity and range measuring capability with a inertial measurement unit and vision based lander system to provide terrain relative navigation technology. The COBALT integrated system acquires measurements and generates a navigation and landing solution in real-time. During the open loop, free flight test campaign it was determined that the integrated computer processing capability was insufficient for real-time calculation needs and needed to be increased to a parallel processing capability. The required technology scope was changed to include computer architecture enhancements which were incorporated into a new project named SPLICE. ",

        "description": "Miniaturized microwave radiometers deployed on nanosatellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) are now demonstrating the ability to provide science-quality weather measurements, such as the 3U Micro-sized Microwave Atmospheric Satellite-2A (MicroMAS-2A). The goal of having cost-effective miniature instruments distributed in LEO is to field constellations and improve temporal and geospatial coverage. The Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitations structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats (TROPICS) is a constellation of six 3U CubeSats, based on MicroMAS-2A, scheduled to launch in 2020. Each CubeSat hosts a scanning 12-channel passive microwave radiometer. TROPICS will provide increased temporal resolution of less than 60 minutes compared to larger satellites in polar orbit such as NOAA-20 with the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), which has a revisit rate of 7.6 hours. [1] The TROPICS rapid refresh rate will provide high value investigations of inner-core conditions for tropical cyclones. [2] Calibration for CubeSats presents new challenges as standard blackbody targets are too bulky to fit on CubeSats. Instead, we use internal noise diodes for calibration on CubeSats. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) instrument has shown noise diodes to be very stable on orbit [3], but they have not been tested on-orbit at TROPICS frequencies.   In order to provide state of the art calibration for CubeSats, methods must be developed to track and correct noise diode drift. We will quantitatively determine the radiometric accuracy of MicroMAS-2A and compare it to state of the art instruments to provide an assessment of CubeSat performance. Radiometric accuracy is determined by using the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) and the Rosenkranz Line-by-Line (LBL) Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) with inputs from GPS radio occultation (GPSRO), radiosondes, and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models in order calculate simulated brightness temperatures that are used as the ground truth. We perform on-orbit calibration corrections using histogram matchups between MicroMAS-2A and the MicroWave Humidity Sounder (MWHS)-2 on the Chinese weather satellite FengYun (FY)-3C. The double difference technique is then used to compare MicroMAS-2A performance to ATMS.   We also develop a novel method of calibration for CubeSat constellations such as TROPICS by incorporating solar and lunar periodic intrusions as an additional source of information to counter noise diode drift. These solar and lunar intrusions occur as well for existing satellites hosting microwave radiometers in polar orbits, but are much more infrequent than for the TROPICS constellation’s scanning payload and are typically treated as an observational and calibration limiting constraint. The higher rate of occurrence of intrusions motivates the novel idea of using the intrusions to support calibration. An algorithm is developed to compare expected effective brightness temperature from solar and lunar measurements to actual measured brightness temperatures, and the algorithm is tested using ATMS lunar intrusion data. In addition, we develop an architecture for TROPICS to track noise diode drift. The frequency of single difference matchups, double difference matchups using both intra- and inter- Simultaneous Nadir Observations (SNO), and solar and lunar intrusions is determined. The impact of orbital parameters and phasing on direct radiance validation opportunities is also studied. ",

        "description": "A Leidenfrost Driven Waste-Water Separator (LDS) is proposed in response to TA 6.1: Environmental Control and Life Support Systems and Habitation Systems. The LDS aims to provide a solution to the problems of waste management (TA 6.1.3), and water recovery and management (TA 6.1.2), as identified by NASA. The LDS will take advantage of the Leidenfrost effect, which is a phenomenon experienced by a liquid when it comes into close vicinity of a surface that is significantly hotter than the liquid's boiling temperature. Instant evaporation causes the formation of an insulating vapor layer that allows the liquid to float. This effect is what is responsible for floating droplets of water on a hot skillet. In the microgravity of space, liquids impacting a superheated surface are able to rebound due to this insulating vapor layer formation. The LDS will take advantage of a nozzle that will eject droplets of human waste into a channel of superheated walls made of superhydrophobic materials. These ejected droplets will propagate through the system channel, rebounding off the walls and becoming smaller and smaller as a result of water evaporation. Solid waste left over from the solution will leave the channel to be stored. The water vapor left over in the channel will be extracted out of the system.   Research into microgravity fluid phenomenon is critical for the development of the proposed Leidenfrost Driven Waste-Water Separator. This research can be effectively conducted in the Dryden Drop Tower at Portland State University. Research includes investigations into the impact of different surface materials on the separation of water and solid waste, variations in the rate of evaporation due to surface material and superheat, and effects of droplet ejection methods on overall effectiveness of the system. These areas of interest must be investigated for effective development of the LDS. Lasers used to develop superhydrophobic materials, rapid prototyping equipment, and a machine shop with welding stations means that the LDS can be designed and fabricated at PSU.  The Leidenfrost Driven Waste-Water Separator is a system that not only offers a solution to TA6.1.2 and TA6.1.3, but it also opens avenues for research that can provide meaningful insights into the development of other space technologies. As stated earlier, the research into microgravity fluid mechanics must be conducted in order to design an effective LDS. Results from the conducted research can be used to help aid in the design of other systems for space because of the fact that many systems used in space interact with and make use of fluids. The LDS provides the opportunity to develop a system that can solve the problem of waste-water separation, as well as provide an avenue for meaningful research into microgravity fluid mechanics.",

Other gas nano-sensors (ammonia, CO, hydrazine, etc.) and low-power sensing modalities of high interest in Exploration Medicine may be included.

We finalize the design of an ultra-low power wireless sensing platform (JSC) and integrate it with an ultra-low power CO2 sensor (ARC) to give a flight-certifiable, wearable or peel/stick platform that can operate for years at a time without battery recharge/replacement. The sensor will be forward-compatible with existing ISS RFID inventory management infrastructure for follow-on flight demos, and costs will be augmented by AES funding to integrate SBIR-produced location tracking sensors. This will provide a capability un-matched by any SoA wireless sensor package and can easily extend to other sensing modalities (ammonia, radiation, etc.), addressing the JSC technology priority area of Automation and ECLSS.

        "closeoutSummary": "Environmental sensing will be key to autonomous vehicle operation and crew health monitoring in tended/untended long-duration habitats for Human Space Exploration in deep space.  Small wireless sensors, based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, can provide unprecedented capacity to monitor crew/habitat health.  We are developing a next-generation, wireless air quality sensor capable of operating for years on a small coin-cell battery without crewmember intervention.  Integrating a state-of-the-art commercial CO2 sensor, this platform can acquire and wirelessly transport samples with a projected battery lifetime of to 27.5 years on a CR2450 coin cell (10 mins./sample).  Having proven the feasibility of store-and-forward data transport using RFID links in year 1, we have focused this year on integrating the algorithm into the RFID-enhanced Autonomous Logistics Management (REALM) to study both its impact on REALM inventory management and REALM’s impact on RFID data transfer.  These experiments have guided a re-implementation that will position REALM for RFID sensing support on Station/Gateway.  We have also designed and implemented an interface to the most advanced COTS CO2 sensor available as an alternative to the ARC CO2 nano-materials sensor, whose continues at ARC.  With improvements in reducing quiescent current consumption, at duty cycles comparable to PCO2M, this exceeds the high end of the promised range with a lifetime in excess of 13 years CR2032 coin cell, and with a slightly larger CR2450, it will achieve close in excess of 27.5 years.   As a next step, we plan to infuse position sensing into the platform and transition this to a flight implementation under AES Logistics Management to demonstrate on ISS with REALM-1. ",

The application desired for this project would examine much higher reduction ratios in the 500:1 to 2000:1 range, input speeds would be in the mid thousands of RPM. \\nNext Step: At the completion of this project, two different paths would be desirable: further maturation of the gearbox for the intended rover specific application; and, use this project as a capability demonstrator.",

Small debris is currently undetectable and poses a hazard to spacecraft. Recently discovered precursor plasma solitons excited by fast-moving charged debris in a plasma could enable mapping of small orbital debris by simple sensors on a fleet of cubesats. The proposed technology would revolutionize our interaction with small orbital debris by enabling spacecraft placement in less hazardous orbits as well as quantitative evaluation of mitigation efforts. Additionally, the proposed technology may be applicable to dust detection efforts near other planetary targets.  Preliminary calculations indicate that small debris in orbits from 400-1600km altitude could be mapped in less than 1 year using fewer than 100 cubesats. We propose to assess the feasibility of this concept by modeling the precursor solitons produced by sample debris objects of varying velocity and charge, as well as the long-distance propagation of solitons through spatially varying plasma environments. Additionally, we will develop preliminary designs of the cubesat fleet required to map small debris by detecting plasma solitons.",

        "description": "The Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) concept provides game-changing propulsion and power capabilities that would revolutionize interplanetary travel. DFD is based on the Princeton Field-Reversed Configuration (PFRC) fusion reactor under development at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. The mission context we are proposing is delivery of a Pluto orbiter with a lander. DFD provides high thrust to allow for reasonable transit times to Pluto while delivering substantial mass to orbit: 1000 kg delivered in 4 years. Since DFD provides power as well as propulsion in one integrated device, it will also provide as much as 1 MW of power to the payloads upon arrival. This enables high-bandwidth communication, powering of the lander from orbit, and radically expanded options for instrument design. The data acquired by New Horizons' recent Pluto flyby is just a tiny fraction of the scientific data that could be generated from an orbiter and lander. Engine modeling accomplished during Phase I has shown that we can expect 2.5 to 5 N of thrust per megawatt of fusion power, with an Isp of about 10,000 seconds and 200 kW available as electrical power. We have evaluated the components of the Pluto trajectory including an Earth departure spiral, constant thrust planar transfer, and Pluto insertion using these thrust and Isp levels, and confirmed the plausibility of the proposed mission. In fact, the mission can depart from LEO with about the mass we originally estimated for an interplanetary insertion, widening the range of available launch vehicles and reducing the cost.##The key objective of the Phase II proposal is to further advance the design and TRL of selected subsystems, such as the superconducting coils, RF heating, and shielding. PPPL will perform experimental work on the existing PFRC-2 testbed using a gas puff valve, to further investigate the dynamics of the thrust augmentation system (additional gaw flowing through the FRC scrape-offlayer). We will explore the design of a no-thrust mode that captures and reuses the propellant, possibly extracting more power while in orbit around Pluto. Finally, we will develop a model of the synchrotron radiation that is specific to the FRC configuration, as available models are derived from tokamaks. Direct Fusion Drive is a unique fusion engine concept with a physically feasible approach that would dramatically increase the capability of outer planet missions. The fusion-enabled Pluto mission proposed here is credible, exciting, and the benefits to this and all outer planet missions are difficult to overstate. The truly game-changing levels of thrust and power in a modestly sized package could integrate with our current launch infrastructure while radically expanding the science capability of these missions.",

        "description": "Consistent and reliable rocket engine ignition has yet to be proven through an additively manufactured torch igniter for liquid propellants. The coupling of additive manufacturing and liquid fuel propulsion systems is the next great advancement for space technology and will ensure that spaceflight remains safe, affordable, and sustainable for our nation. It is hypothesized that a 3D printed torch igniter would act as a suitable replacement for torch igniters machined out of wrought metal stock.  3D printed injectors and thrusters have recently been built by NASA and undergone testing, but to date, they have either been ignited with a hypergolic propellant or a traditionally-machined torch igniter. An additively manufactured igniter could be printed directly into the injector system, further reducing the part quantity and complexity. Validation of a printed device provides a low-cost, quickly-manufactured device using state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities without diminishing overall engine performance. Explicitly, the ability to additively manufacture the igniter reduces part counts, manufacturing time, and weld joints. The part and welding reduction would inherently raise device reliability. This is critical for main engine ignition and offers the ability for multiple ignition events.  The proposed research is directly aligned with objectives listed in NASA's Space Technology Roadmap for liquid propellants, 1.2 Liquid Rocket Propulsion Systems. The sub-goal of which states, Improve the production and manufacturability of large booster engines to reduce cost without sacrificing performance or reliability.  A 3D printed igniter would be applicable for liquid hydrogen and liquid methane fuels. Currently, liquid hydrogen is used for NASA's RS-25 and J-2X engines. However, there has been growing interest in research and development of liquid methane systems due to in-situ resource utilization during space flight. Consequently, creation of an additively manufactured igniter, capable of handling both fuels, is necessary to maintain a competitive stance and to reduce research required to implement an upcoming fuel.  Combining the technology advances of manufacturing and liquid fuels will offer benefits beyond spaceflight. Aerospace applications alone range from small in-space thrusters to torch igniters used in core-stage engines that have thrust capabilities similar to the space shuttle main engine. Auxiliary uses for this technology includes scramjets, gas-turbines, and other terrestrial ignition needs. The proposed work will address both current and future needs for reliable ignition systems in terrestrial and space systems. Should the hypothesis be disproven, it will be known that state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques are not yet capable of advancing flame torch ignition systems. A successful proof-of-concept would provide a foundation of knowledge to build upon and design simplifications, reducing both the cost and complexity of propulsion systems for years to follow.",

The production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and oxygen from water and carbon dioxide will be essential to astronauts for the exploration of the moon and particularly Mars. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be used as fuels, as reducing agents to extract oxygen regolith metal oxides, and as precursors to the production of methane, other alkanes, methanol, and other alcohols.

        "description": "In future manned planetary exploration missions there is a strong logic that robots will remain central to the mission success. These robots may be called upon to construct habitats, maintain sensors, and assist astronauts both inside and outside the habitats. Yet these robots will have one especially stringent constraint which is not normally placed on legged systems: they must be safe. If legged space robots are to collaborate effectively alongside human partners in planetary missions, we will need controllers that can adapt to human-friendly mechanical designs. Robots with flexible joints appear to have the best potential for these human-oriented applications since this compliance allows them to react to unexpected collisions gently, rather than crushing unexpected disturbances with full motor power. However, joint flexibility achieves safety at the cost of responsiveness, slowing down the performance of the low-level torque control servo in each joint. Whole body controllers, which assume ideal, instantaneous torque sources, must therefore reduce their bandwidth--their speed and performance--to remain stable. Since this reduces the positional accuracy of the swing foot and center of mass while walking, compliant robots are prone to unsafe falls at even moderate speeds. Building on the safe interaction success of the Robonaut project, the Valkyrie Robot from JSC has safe, compliant actuators. My central aim is to demonstrate a new control strategy that supports stable, fast, responsive walking on compliant legs. I will develop a controller that explicitly compensates for non-ideal force sources. My hypothesis is that this controller will significantly improve walking performance and robustness, allowing Valkyrie to double her walking speed and allowing her to hold a glass of water as she does it.     More specifically: (1) I will experimentally identify the collection of model parameters that most accurately predict the robot's behavior. This model will reflect linear dynamics between commanded and sensed torques as well as non-linear rigid body dynamics between sensed torques and robot motion. Then, (2) re-writing the whole body control framework, I will extend this controller to explicitly consider models with slow torque response and thus robots with flexible joints. (3) I will then apply some of the advanced control techniques I have learned in my graduate studies thus far to stabilize this more complex model. Specifically, between the infinite choices of stabilizing controllers, I will chose one which produces a closed loop compliant system with good center of mass and pitch position tracking and compliant swing foot searching. Finally, (4) I will test the validate and tune the performance of this controller by testing on the physical robot.    This research could transform the related field of compliant walking robot design from an art to a science, providing a way to estimate the limits of robot performance in advance of construction. And it could potentially lead to improvements in high speed mobile manipulation and collaborative manipulation between compliant joint legged robots and astronauts. This work also has the potential for global societal scope beyond space technology. Equipped with a robust walking controller, compliant humanoid robots will be safe to have around the house. With improved walking, NASA astronauts, factory workers, and consumers alike will be able to rely on these robots to maintain balance given realistic disturbances, and robots will then be able to fill service areas that require locomotion in close proximity to people: caring for the elderly, delivering goods door-to-door, moving furniture, and tending to people with communicable infections. Robots capable of responsive, flexible and safe interactions with their environments and the people in their environment will create many scientific and engineering opportunities.",

Aerocapture can significantly enhance orbital missions to Mars, Venus, Titan, Uranus, and Neptune. The use of aerocapture instead of propulsive orbit insertion can increase delivered payload by 15% at Mars, 70% at Venus, more than 200% at Titan and Uranus, and an estimated greater than 800% at Neptune. An alternative approach is aerocapture that employs drag instead of lift as a means to modulate the trajectory. Drag modulated aerocapture is a simple, scalable, and likely to be costeffective way to enhance planetary science missions. The focus of this proposal is to address some of the key entry technology challenges for the single-stage discrete-event architecture.",

The wide bandgap feature enables the SiC device to operate at higher voltages, temperatures, and switching frequencies with greater efficiencies compared to existing Si devices. However, the unique space environment presents a great challenge to the device performance and reliability. To safely deploy SiC power devices for space missions, one has to first answer the question of how SiC-devices survive from the harsh radiation environment in space. Fundamental research into the radiation susceptibility and failure mechanisms of SiC is necessary. The overall goal of the proposed project is to advance the understanding of radiation failure mechanism in silicon carbide (SiC) materials for power devices, and provide the guidelines to design and fabricate SiC-based devices with higher resistance to radiation single-event effects (SEEs).",

        "description": "Nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) offers twice the specific impulse of the best chemical combustion engines and can thus halve space mission transit times to allow further exploration and understanding of the universe to become feasible NASA missions. The large specific impulses achieved are due to the ejection of light hydrogen gas at high temperatures sustained by the nuclear fuel elements. One of the most significant challenges in implementing this technology however is producing engines where both the fissionable and containment materials resist hydrogen embrittlement at operating conditions (~2700 K). Currently, ceramic-metallic (CERMET) fuel is used, which embeds chemical vapor deposition (CVD) coated fissionable material in a tungsten matrix. These porous CVD films require microscale thicknesses to begin extending engine lifetimes yet still do not reach the required protection levels. We propose to use atomic layer deposition (ALD) of a chemically-bonded barrier film as a nuclear fuel coating to prevent the reaction of CERMET fuel with the hydrogen propellant. The coating will be designed to resist hydrogen reaction, adsorption, and diffusion, thereby protecting the underlying fissionable uranium fuel material from both chemical redox and reaction which causes embrittlement and fuel loss. The protective, pinhole-free, nanoscale coating will also have a high melting point, thermal conductivity, neutron transparency, and resist both delamination and thermal fatigue caused by thermal expansion mismatch during temperature ramps. ALD utilizes successive self-limiting reactions to offer exquisitely tunable film thicknesses. This attribute will reduce fissionable fuel volume displacement by depositing the thinnest films possible that still resist hydrogen diffusion and mechanical stresses. Both computation and experiment will be used to design and test the best coating materials.",
        "benefits": "This project will provide unprecedented understanding of dominate microstructural diffusion mechanisms as well as data for kinetic predictions to guide mitigation strategies against deleterious hydrogen reactions with the fuel source. This program brings to bear collaborative interactions between university-industry-NASA partnerships to address the need for innovative advanced coatings strategies for next-generation NTP cermet fuel sources.",

Under E-OpTICS, we propose to develop and demonstrate a non-mechanical laser beam steering sensor for integration into NASA Langley Research Center's Navigation Doppler Lidar (NDL). The two-year investigation will include design, fabrication, characterization and environmental testing of a liquid crystal polarization grating (LCPG) based non-mechanical beam steering (NMBS) hardware. E-OpTICS LCPG NMBS hardware will meet the requirements for NDL which include 1550 nm laser beam steering using a 5 cm clear aperture over a large 60 x 60o field of regard. E-OpTICS will deliver a LCPG NMBS beam steering device that yields fast (<10 ms) pointing speeds, random access pointing capability and an agile low size (0.6 m3), weight (<0.5 kg) and power (~0.5 W) package. This technology will provide an order of magnitude improvement in weight and two orders of magnitude improvement in performance and power consumption over mechanical beam steering systems. E-OpTICS will deliver a non-mechanical beam steering system that can be directly infused into NDL and is scalable to other lidar instruments that support NASA's airborne and space-based missions.",

        "description": "According to the decadal study, a key component of the next 10 years of exploration will be sample return missions.  However, these missions are exponentially more expensive than traditional exploration missions because they need two times the delta-V, resulting in exponential growth of its initial mass due to the rocket equations.  A key to offsetting this increased cost is through in-situ resource utilization and miniaturization.        The NIMPH project develops a micro-ISRU system for producing LOX and LH2 for return propellant.  The system takes advantage of developments in the cubesat arena to reduce the dry mass of the ISRU system by 90% compared to current systems.  This will allow missions to refuel at their destinations, such as Europa, Mars and the Lunar poles, drastically reducing the size and cost of the mission.",
